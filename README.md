## Usage
1. Hold down a key when typing and wait for the pop-up to appear. Try it with uppercase letters, punctuation marks, and other symbols too.
2. To select the character you desire, you can either press the number or click on the button itself. 
3. There is also a shortcut you can use: while holding the key, press the number of the button before the popup appears.
